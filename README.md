### Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santander-product-recommendation/data


## Overview -

Under their current system, a small number of Santanderâ€™s customers receive many recommendations while many others rarely see any resulting in an uneven customer experience. With a more effective recommendation system in place, Santander can better meet the individual needs of all customers and ensure their satisfaction no matter where they are in life.


## Dataset Description - 

In this competition, you are provided with 1.5 years of customers behavior data from Santander bank to predict what new products customers will purchase. The data starts at 2015-01-28 and has monthly records of products a customer has, such as "credit card", "savings account", etc. You will predict what additional products a customer will get in the last month, 2016-06-28, in addition to what they already have at 2016-05-28. These products are the columns named: ind_(xyz)_ult1, which are the columns #25 - #48 in the training data. You will predict what a customer will buy in addition to what they already had at 2016-05-28. 

The test and train sets are split by time, and public and private leaderboard sets are split randomly.
